# **Welcome!** 

<br>

I am a freshwater ecologist with a background in public administration. I'm currently in my second year of my PhD at Cornell University working on zooplankton in the Great Lakes and at a global scale. Please see my research interests for more information and [reach out](https://sfigary.github.io/website/Contact.html) if you have any questions.
