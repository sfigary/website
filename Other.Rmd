# **Public Service**

<br>

I am passionate about bringing science into public service. Since 2014, I have served on four local-level environmental boards, including working groups, and Conservation and Natural Resources Commissions. I have been active in several projects including delineating a wetland to develop a new trail system in Rhode Island, creating a land management plan for an emerging salt marsh, and now tackling deer management in the public natural lands for the City of Ithaca. 

<br>

* **City of Ithaca Parks, Recreation and Natural Resources Commission**, [member](https://www.cityofithaca.org/622/Parks-Recreation-and-Natural-Resources-C) (Ithaca, New York: 2019 - present)
* **Narragansett Conservation Commission**, Vice Chair (Narragansett, Rhode Island: 2016 - 2019)
  * Middlebridge Conservation Plan Working Group
* **Ambler Environmental Advisory Council**, member (Ambler, Pennsylvania: 2014 - 2015)

<br>

I am always looking for new ways to engage in public service.  Please reach out if you have any opportunities.
