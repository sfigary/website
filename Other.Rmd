# **Public Service**

<br>

With my background in both freshwater ecology and public administration, I am passionate about brining science into public service. Since 2014, I have served on town Conservation or Natural Resources Commissions in the three towns I have live in during that time. Here, I have been active in several projects including delineating a wetland to develop a new trail system in Narragansett, RI, creating a land management plan for an emerging salt marsh, and now tackling deer management in the public natural lands for the City of Ithaca. 

<br>

* **City of Ithaca Parks, Recreation and Natural Resources Commission**, member (appointment: 2019 - present)
* **Narragansett Conservation Commission**, Vice Chair (appointment: 2016 - 2019)
  * Middlebridge Conservation Plan Working Group
* **Ambler Environmental Advisory Council**, member (appointment: 2014 - 2015)

<br>

I am always looking for new ways to merge my research interests with public service.  Please reach out if you have any opportunities.
