## Welcome! 

I am a Freshwater Ecologist with a background in Public Administration. I'm currently in my second year of my PhD at Cornell University working on zooplankton in the Great Lakes and at a global scale. Please see my research interests for more information.

This site is a work in progress. Please [reach out](https://sfigary.github.io/website/Contact.html) if you have any questions.
